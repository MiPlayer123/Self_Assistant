# [PBI-003-3] Implement IPC Handlers for Local Models

## Description
This task focuses on creating the necessary IPC (Inter-Process Communication) handlers in the Electron main process to manage local model operations. These handlers will receive requests from the renderer process (via `LocalChatModel`) and interact with the `node-llama-cpp` library to perform chat inference, abstracting the complexities of local model management from the renderer.

## Status History
- **2024-05-22 11:20** - Proposed - Task created for implementing IPC handlers for local models - AI_Agent

## Requirements
*   Implement IPC listeners in the Electron main process for local model chat functionalities.
*   Utilize `node-llama-cpp` within the main process to load local models and perform inference.
*   Handle model loading, context management, and chat stream processing.
*   Return responses to the renderer process via IPC, including data and any errors.

## Implementation Plan
1.  **Create `LocalModelIPC.ts` (or similar):** A new file in the `electron/` directory to contain all local model IPC logic and `node-llama-cpp` interactions.
2.  **IPC Event Handling:** Set up `ipcMain.handle` for a dedicated local model channel (e.g., `'invokeLocalChatModel'`).
3.  **Local Model Initialization:** Inside the IPC handler, manage the `node-llama-cpp` instance, model loading, and context creation.
4.  **Chat Inference Logic:** Implement the core logic for `sendMessage` using `LlamaChatSession`.
5.  **Error Handling:** Ensure robust error handling for `node-llama-cpp` operations and IPC communication.
6.  **Integrate with `main.ts`:** Call the initialization function for the local model IPC handlers from `electron/main.ts`.

## Test Plan
*   **IPC Communication Test:** Verify that the renderer process can successfully send requests to and receive responses from the main process via the new IPC handlers.
*   **Local Model Loading Test:** Attempt to load a dummy local model (or a small one if available) through the IPC handler and confirm successful initialization.
*   **Basic Chat Inference Test:** Send a simple chat message via the `LocalChatModel` (which will use IPC) and verify a placeholder or actual response is received.

## Verification
*   No console errors related to IPC communication or `node-llama-cpp` in both renderer and main processes.
*   Local models can be selected in the UI without immediate crashes.
*   Basic chat interaction with local models functions as expected (even with placeholder responses initially).

## Files Modified
*   `electron/main.ts`
*   `electron/localModelIpcHandlers.ts` (new file)
*   `src/preload.ts` (potentially, to expose IPC for local models)
