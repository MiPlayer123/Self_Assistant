# PBI-003: Local LLM Integration

## Overview
This PBI aims to integrate local Large Language Models (LLMs) into the application, allowing users to utilize the application's AI capabilities without requiring an internet connection. This enhances privacy and usability by reducing reliance on external API services.

## Problem Statement
Currently, the application relies solely on cloud-based LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google). This dependency means the application is unusable offline and raises potential data privacy concerns as user data is sent to third-party services. To address these issues, local LLM inference is required.

## User Stories
*   **As a user, I want to run a local LLM** so that I can use the application offline and ensure data privacy.
*   **As a user, I want to select and configure local models from the UI** so that I can easily switch between local and cloud providers and manage local model settings.
*   **As a user, I want core application features (problem extraction, solution generation, debugging) to work with local models** so that the offline experience is seamless and fully functional.
*   **As a user, I want clear instructions for local model setup and download** so that I can easily get started with local inference.

## Technical Approach
1.  **Research Local LLM Solutions:** Identify robust and performant local LLM libraries or frameworks compatible with Electron/Node.js (e.g., `node-llama-cpp`, Ollama). Prioritize solutions that support streaming and multi-modality for future enhancements.
2.  **Implement `LocalModel` Provider:** Create `LocalModel.ts` and `ChatModel.ts` within `src/models/providers/local/` that adhere to the existing `BaseModel` and `IChatModel` interfaces. This will encapsulate the logic for interacting with the chosen local LLM solution.
3.  **Integrate with `ModelManager`:** Modify `src/models/ModelManager.ts` to instantiate `LocalModel` when the `local` provider is selected. This will involve passing appropriate configuration.
4.  **Electron IPC for Model Loading/Inference:** If the chosen local LLM solution requires native binaries or extensive processing, implement Electron IPC (Inter-Process Communication) to offload heavy operations to the main process, ensuring the UI remains responsive.
5.  **UI Updates:** Extend the model selection UI to include a 'Local' option. This may involve adding new configuration fields for model paths, names, etc.
6.  **Model Management:** Consider how local models will be downloaded and managed (e.g., local storage, user-specified paths).

## UX/UI Considerations
*   Provide clear feedback to the user regarding local model loading and inference status.
*   Offer an intuitive way to select and configure local models.
*   Potentially display local model performance metrics if feasible.

## Acceptance Criteria
*   Application successfully performs problem extraction, solution generation, and debugging using a locally hosted LLM without internet access.
*   A 'Local' model provider option is available and functional in the application's model selection interface.
*   Users can configure the path to their local model files (if applicable).
*   Performance for common tasks with a recommended local model is acceptable (e.g., response times are reasonable).
*   Instructions for setting up and downloading local models are easily accessible and clear.

## Dependencies
*   Electron.js for desktop application framework.
*   Node.js for backend logic.
*   A selected local LLM library (e.g., `node-llama-cpp`).
*   Existing `ModelManager` and provider interfaces.

## Open Questions
*   Which specific local LLM framework/library will be chosen for initial implementation (e.g., `node-llama-cpp`, Ollama API)?
*   How will local models be distributed and managed within the application (e.g., bundled, user-downloaded)?
*   What are the minimum system requirements for running local models effectively?
