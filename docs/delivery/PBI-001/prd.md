# PBI-001: Wagoo UI Theme and Window Behavior Updates

**Parent Backlog**: [Product Backlog](../backlog.md)

## Overview

Transform the current application UI to match Wagoo's vision with a modern, dark translucent theme inspired by professional design principles. This includes comprehensive styling updates, window positioning improvements, and a unified CSS architecture.

## Problem Statement

The current UI theme and window behavior doesn't align with Wagoo's intended aesthetic and user experience. The application needs:
- A cohesive dark translucent theme with white text
- Proper window positioning at bottom-right of screen
- Better window resizing functionality  
- Unified CSS architecture for maintainability
- Consistent styling across all chat components

## User Stories

- As a user, I want the window to appear in the bottom-right corner so it's unobtrusive but accessible
- As a user, I want a dark translucent background with white text so the interface feels modern and professional
- As a user, I want to be able to resize the window smoothly so I can adjust it to my preferences
- As a developer, I want unified CSS so the codebase is maintainable and consistent

## Technical Approach

1. **Window Configuration Updates**: Modify electron/main.ts to position window at bottom-right
2. **CSS Architecture**: Create unified, modular CSS system in src/index.css
3. **Component Styling**: Update all chat-related components for consistent theming
4. **Theme Variables**: Implement CSS custom properties for consistent colors and effects

## UX/UI Considerations

- Dark translucent background with a professional aesthetic
- White text for good contrast and readability
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Maintain existing functionality while improving visual appeal
- Ensure accessibility with proper contrast ratios
