# PBI-004: Offline Access for Subscribed Users

**Status**: Agreed  
**Parent**: [Product Backlog](../backlog.md)

## Overview
Implement differentiated offline access experience where subscribed users can continue using Wagoo without internet connection while free users are prompted to upgrade for offline access.

## Problem Statement
Currently, all users see the same generic "No Internet Connection" screen regardless of subscription status. This doesn't leverage the subscription tier to provide value-added offline access for paying customers, missing an opportunity to both serve paid users better and incentivize free users to upgrade.

## User Stories
- **As a free user**, I want to see a clear message about upgrading for offline access when internet is unavailable, so I understand the premium value proposition
- **As a subscribed user**, I want to use Wagoo offline with my local models, so I can continue working even without internet connection
- **As a subscribed user**, I want to be notified when I'm offline but still have access, so I understand my premium benefits are working

## Technical Approach
1. **Local Subscription Persistence**: Cache subscription status in localStorage with expiry validation
2. **Offline Detection**: Hook to detect network status and validate cached subscription permissions
3. **Differentiated UI**: Enhanced ConnectionErrorScreen with subscription-aware messaging
4. **Offline Notification**: Toast notification for subscribed users entering offline mode
5. **App Flow Updates**: Routing logic to handle offline scenarios based on subscription status

## UX/UI Considerations
- **Free Users Offline**: Clear upgrade messaging with subscription portal access when online
- **Subscribed Users Offline**: Brief notification then seamless transition to app with local model default
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Distinct visual treatment for upgrade vs continue offline options
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Graceful degradation for expired cached subscriptions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Free users see upgrade prompt when offline
- [ ] Subscribed users can access full app functionality offline
- [ ] Local subscription cache persists with proper expiry validation
- [ ] App defaults to local model selection when offline
- [ ] Offline notification appears for subscribed users
- [ ] Subscription expiry handled gracefully
- [ ] First-time users require online verification
- [ ] Smooth transitions between online/offline modes

## Dependencies
- Existing subscription system and local storage utilities
- Local model infrastructure for offline functionality
- Network detection capabilities

## Open Questions
- None at this time
